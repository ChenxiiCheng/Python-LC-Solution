#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], D: int) -> int:
        #Solution
        left, right = max(weights), sum(weights)
        while left < right:
            # mid: guess the capacity of ship
            # cur: loaded capacity of current ship
            # need: number of ship needed（需要运几次 次/天）
            mid, need, cur = (left + right) // 2, 1, 0
            for w in weights:
                if cur + w > mid:  # current ship meets its capacity
                    need += 1
                    cur = 0
                cur += w
            #we need too many ships, so we need to increase capacity to reduce num of ships needed
            # we are able to ship with good num of ships, but we still need to find the optimal max capacity
            if need > D: 
                left = mid + 1
            else: 
                right = mid
        return left
```
